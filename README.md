# design-pattern-detection
This project is to automatically detect software design patterns implemented in Java project sources code using Static Analisys.

This program considers algorithms introduced in Automatic Design Pattern Detection by Dirk Heuzeroth, Thomas Holl, Gustav Högström and Welf Löwe.


It takes a Github's repository HTTPS URL as an input to download a Java project and analyses them.

Completed detections: Observer, Visitor, and Chain of Responsibility design patterns.

Further patterns to detect: Composite and Mediatordesign patterns.

More pattern detection methods based on static analysis can be added.

It also contains example source codes that can be used for testing.
