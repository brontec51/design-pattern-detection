# design-pattern-detection
This project is to automatically detect software design patterns implemented in Java project source codes using static analisys.

This program considers following algorithms introduced in Automatic Design Pattern Detection by Dirk Heuzeroth, Thomas Holl, Gustav Högström and Welf Löwe.


It takes a Github's repository html address as an input to download candidate's Java project source codes and analyses them.

Completed: Observer, Visitor, and Chain of Responsibility design patterns.

Further patterns: Composite and Mediatordesign patterns.

More pattern detection methods using static analysis can be added.

It also contains example source codes that can be used for testing.
